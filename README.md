# ðŸ—º What is Mundus?
 **Mundus** is a simple desktop web app that displays relevant and interesting data about countries from all around the world utilizing the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/).<br>
 This project was developed in two days utilizing vanilla Javascript and Bootstrap, though I have plans to refactor the Javascript code using jQuery. 
## How to run 
 Simply clone the project and open the `index.html` file located in the `root` folder.
## How to use 
 To start browsing countries, choose the ****search method**** by clicking the dropdown. If you need any info about the search method, information and examples are provided when  hovering the mouse over the tooltip (â„¹) to the right. Then, type your query in the text box and click the search button.<br>
 Mundus will then display the countries retrieved from the search in a carousel, with the relevant information retrieved from the `GET` request for every country found in the search.<br>
 If a country has two or more of the same information type (for instance, timezones, currencies, languages), only the most relevant one is displayed.<br>
 ðŸ—º It's also possible to change between two different themes - ****World and Map**** - by using the switch to the right of the tooltip. Utilizing it changes the background of the website, as well as the logo color scheme and the image for the search button.
 <br><br>Thank you for reading and thanks to the team behind the REST Countries API for developing such a fun API to work with ðŸ˜€.
